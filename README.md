CS551K 2023-2024 - Assessment 3 - Multi-Agent Programming Contest
============================

This assessment is based on the 
[Multi-Agent Programming Contest](https://multiagentcontest.org/),
where participants program agents to compete with each other in a
predefined game.

_MASSim_ simulations run in discrete steps. Agents connect remotely to the
contest server, receive percepts and send their actions, which are in turn
executed by _MASSim_.
